JAVA test

1. java and javac are commands, javac is used to compile java programs and create class files, java is used to run the class files.

2. JDK: It is java development kit, it contains JRE and JVM, 
   JRE: JRE is java run time environment, it contais javac.
   JVM: JVM is java virtual machine it contains java and libraries
        
4. class: class is basically a non primitive datatype and it is also called as design.It contains body.
   for ex: class Sweet{
   
   }//class declaration
   
   object: object is a real world entity,
   

5. Array is group  of values with same datatype.
   
   
6. .java file is the source file of java, it is not platform independent. JAVA cannot understand .java file.
   .class file is created after the compilation of .java file, .class file is platform independent that is we can run the .class file in any platform.
   

7. length is 7


9. JAVA is a platform independet programming language.

10. Variable is the name given to values.
    There are three types of variables 
	1.) Local Variables.
	2.) Instance variales.
	3.) Static variables.
	
	1.)Local variable is declared inside a method. The scope of local variables ends with the respected method body.
	    
	    Ex. class Bike{
		    public static void main(String[] args){
			    
                int a=10;     			
			
			}   
		    }
	
	2.)Instance variables is declared inside class but outside the method, we can access the instance variable in anywhere in the class.
  
         Ex. class Bike{
		      
			      int a=10;
                  		 
		    public static void main(String[] args){
			    
                System.out.println(a);     			
			
			}   
		    }

	3.)Static variable values are fixed it cannot be re intialized.

	
12. Data type specifies what type of date can be stored in variables.

     Types of datatypes
	 1)Primitive Datatype
	 2)Non Primitive Datatype
	 
	 
	 Primitive datatype
	 1)byte: is used to store numbers without decimal values.
	 2)short: is used to store numbers without decimal values.
	 3)int: is used to store numbers without decimal values.
	 4)long: is used to store numbers without decimal values.
	 5)float: is used to store decimal values.
	 6)double: is used to store decimal values.
	 7)char: is used to store single character.
	 8)boolean: true/false.
	 
13. JAVA features
    *Object oriented programming.
	*Platform Independent.
	*Easy to learn.
	*Big Community.
	

16. It is print statement used to print messages on console.

17. Double equal operator is used to check for validation.

    Ex: if(a==b){
	}//checking whether a is equal to b through double equal operator


18. Dot operator is used to select.
    
	Ex: class Gun{
	      
		    int a=10;
			Gun(){
			}
		  
		  
	     }
           
		class GunRunner{
		     public static void main(String[] args){
			 Gun ref=new Gun();
			 System.out.println(ref.a); //We are using . operator to basically tell the compiler to select a from class Gun.
			 }
		
		
		}
		
	
20. 10 java keywords
    
	1) new
	2) int
    3) float 
	4) String
	5) double
	6) byte
	7) char
	8) boolean
	9) short
	10) long
	

11. class variables are those variables whic declared outside the method and inside the class.
    These variables can be accessed in any methods declared in the same class.


14. Types of arrays
    
    Arrays can be classified based on the type of data we are storing in it.
    1)byte
    2)int 
    3)String
	
	
8. public static void main()
  
   public: Access Specifier
   static: Non Access Specifier
   void: return type
   main: name of the method

19. object class.
